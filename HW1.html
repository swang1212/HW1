        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <h4>Early Life</h4>
        <p>Fez was born as a son of Paulie, a strip club manager and an unnamed mother he never met. When Fez was still a child he was taken by his grandmother Marie O'Neill, a drug dealer, as his father was physically abusive to him, which led Marie to show up in his club one day and shoot him two times in his thighs for giving Fez a black eye. From that moment she became Fezco's caretaker.</p>
        <p>One day a woman left Marie her baby until 10pm, but eventually she never came back for him. Fez tried to take care of the boy but no matter what he did, he couldn't stop crying as he was missing his mother. Eventually, he was adopted by both Marie and Fez, who treated him like a family member from the start, even giving him an affectionate name "Ashtray"; from the one time when he tried to eat discarded cigarettes from the ashtray.</p>
        <p>While Fez became responsible for drug dealing and helping his grandmother run a shop as well as taking care of Ashtray, Marie's health became more and more deteriorated until one day when she collapsed on the bathroom's floor; because of her occupation, calling 911 was not an option, so Fez decided to take Marie to the hospital alone by a car despite being too young to even drive, but Marie got help too late and was bedridden to the rest of her life, which left Fezco solely responsible for not only her drug business, but also running the store, and becoming the caretaker of both her and Ashtray.</p>
        <h4>Season 1</h4>
        <p>Fezco is a young drug dealer, while also running a small shop. He is highlighted by the relationship he has with Rue in the series which is described as "friends". It is later known in the series that he thinks of Rue as his sister and acts in accordance to that revelation. He sells drugs to Rue on several occasions without her having to pay for it. His concern for her is first seen when his drug seller came by and manipulated Rue into taking fentanyl, in order to avoid him from sexually assaulting her he bought the substance. His concern for Rue is also seen when he decided to stop selling drugs to her for her own good. He listened to Rue complain about her friends and Nate's violence. He confronted Nate and passively threatened him.</p>

        <h3>Relationships</h3>
        <h4>Rue</h4>
        <p>Fezco was the one who sold drugs to Rue her first time, and has since been her drug dealer. Since "Made You Look", he and Rue have had a falling out as Fezco no longer wanted to sell drugs to Rue out of concern for her which resulted in an argument. Rue later on apologized and thanked him for not selling her drugs. He has multiple times stated Rue is his family, seeing her as his little sister.</p>
        <h4>Ashtray</h4>
        <p>Ashtray was abandoned with Fezco and his grandmother as a baby, offered as collateral for a deal but was never retrieved. He's then adopted by Fez and his grandmother, who raise him as their own and affectionately name him "Ashtray" after he tries to eat a burnt cigarette while taking a bath in the sink. For all intents and purposes, Ashtray is Fez's little brother, though Fez treats him with maturity and respect as he would an adult. Ash is also Fez's business partner, often present at drug deals and meetings with Mouse, he also sells to Rue in the first episode. While Fez became responsible for drug dealing and helping his grandmother run a shop as well as taking care of Ashtray.</p>
